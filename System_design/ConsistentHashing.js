// Hashing is a computationally efficient way of information retrieval.
// In hashing, a hash function is generally used to map the information to a storage pool by generating a hash value using a well-defined logic. 

// Consistent hashing is an improvement over normal Hashing. Here, the user and servers are located virtually in a circular ring structure called the
