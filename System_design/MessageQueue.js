// Messaging System is a common approach to transfer data between systems and applications. A producer generates a message containing some information that is transmitted to the consumers.

// We can do this via direct communication via TCP connection between producer and consumer. However, such a system allows communication between exactly one producer and one consumer.

// a popular way to send a message is via a message broker or a queue.

// One or more producers can communicate with one or more consumers using such messaging systems.
