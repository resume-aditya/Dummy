// A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content
// A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos. 
// If the content is not available on the CDN, it can be fetched from the backend servers. Content on the CDN can have an expiry set by the application or configuration. When the particular content is requested, it is returned with a TTL (time-to-live) header providing the value of expiry.

    //Benefits:
            // Improving website load times : 
            // Reducing bandwidth costs - Bandwidth consumption costs for website hosting is a primary expense for websites. Through caching and other optimizations, CDNs are able to reduce the amount of data an origin server must provide, thus reducing hosting costs for website owners.
            // Increasing content availability and redundancy - Large amounts of traffic or hardware failures can interrupt normal website function. Thanks to their distributed nature, a CDN can handle more traffic and withstand hardware failure better than many origin servers.
            // Improving website security - A CDN may improve security against DDoS ( Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks)


// How does a CDN work?
    // At its core, a CDN is a network of servers linked together with the goal of delivering content as quickly, cheaply, reliably, and securely as possible. In order to improve speed and connectivity, a CDN will place servers at the exchange points between different networks.
