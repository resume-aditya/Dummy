// react elements are similar to HTML events
//  they follow camel casing
// in html returning false does prevent default
// in react explicitly need to do e.preventDefault()

// SyntheticEvent is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. 
// Its API is same as the browser's native event, including stopPropagation() and preventDefault(), except the events work identically across all browsers.
